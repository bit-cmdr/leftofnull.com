<h4 id="1savecodeotherthanonalocaldrive">1. Save code other than on a local drive</h4>

<h4 id="2sharecodeamongteams">2. Share code among teams</h4>

<h4 id="3versioncontrol">3. Version Control</h4>

<p>Everyone that uses source control will list these reasons. I list all these reasons. They're all perfectly accurate too, butare you <em>really</em> using it for all three reasons?</p>

<h3 id="savecodeotherthanonalocaldrive">Save code other than on a local drive</h3>

<p>Of course you do this, if you're using any kind of source control server you can't get away from it. This is, after all, one of the prime selling points to business if they don't understand why you need it. All you have to do is explain that if you don't do this all of the code could be lost in the blink of an eye. You're laptop or computer could get stolen, you're hard drive could fail, you could get hit by a bus... The list goes on, but I'm sure you're well familiar with it.</p>

<h3 id="sharecodeamongteams">Share code among teams</h3>

<p>Again, if you're on a team you most likely are already doing this. Unless you're emailing eachother the zipped up source code or all working on a network share. ::shudder::</p>

<h3 id="versioncontrol">Version Control</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here's where it gets interesting. Are you really taking advantage of the version control capabilities of your source control provider? Every change you commit is stored in the history. To truly realize this functionality you should be committing as often as possible. Depending on your version control system, this doesn't always mean pushing it to the source control server, but creating a bookmark for yourself. More of a personal stash that's stored locally or on a server.</p>

<p>Far too often I encounter a file/module/component with the suffix V2 with no good reason. There are always exceptions to this, so if you encounter a V2 or Vn don't fly off the handle until you're sure previous versions truly aren't needed... <em>then</em> fly off the handle. ;)</p>

<p>See if you are concerned about rolling back or commenting out old code, please don't. This is exactly one of the reasons that version control exists in the first place.</p>]]></description><link>http://leftofnull.com/2014/04/04/why-are-you-using-source-control/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">9d145aae-adf1-4183-9b40-e3646b8ab71d</guid><category><![CDATA[Development]]></category><category><![CDATA[Source Control]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alexander Kahoun]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2014 03:38:31 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Constant Vigilance: Classes or Structs in C#]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>I'm going to have a recurring theme on the blog from time to time. I'll probably have several, but this is the first. The theme here is constant vigilance. The same advice that Mad-Eye Moody gives to Harry Potter in the books. The constant vigilance theme will address poor coding habits that are encouraged by the tools we use. Don't get defensive just yet, and read on. If you disagree, I welcome your comments and will do my best to keep up.</p>

<h2 id="constantvigilance">Constant Vigilance</h2>

<h2 id="classesorstructsinc">Classes or Structs in C#  </h2>

<p>Many of the tools we use, such as ORMs, require us to map to POCOs (Plain Old CLR Objects). WCF encourages POCOs for DataContracts for DTOs and SOAP Objects. This is all fine as they suit the needs of their intended purposes. There's absolutely nothing wrong with it at all. The problem is us. The more these tools are used the more the format becomes old hat. We get used to doing things this way and never question mimicking it in our own systems, even when it's not needed. Let's look at the basic differences between the two.</p>

<h3 id="classes">Classes</h3>

<p>Classes are <em>generally</em> stored on the heap and are cleaned up when the garbage collector no longer detects any references and deems it safe to destroy. Classes are also <em>generally</em> passed by reference. In terms of C++, you're dealing with pointers. Albeit pointers that are managed and cleaned up for you. Keep in mind this is an overly simplistic view of classes and the same over simplicity holds true for the Structs section below. For a very in-depth analysis of stack vs heap, read <a href='http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2009/04/27/the-stack-is-an-implementation-detail.aspx' >this article</a> by Eric Lippert.</p>

<p>Classes excel at a few things. They are good at/for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Encapsulating Data</li>
<li>Hiding Data</li>
<li>Inheritance</li>
<li>Polymorphism</li>
<li>Composition</li>
<li>Abstraction</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep that in mind when we look at the next section.</p>

<h3 id="structs">Structs</h3>

<p>Structs are <em>generally</em> stored on the stack. This alone gives them an advantage over Classes. The stack is accessed quicker than the heap. Mind you, this is a micro-optimization and you're at the mercy of the JITer you're using. This also means that they are generally disposed of upon loss of scope, meaning you don't have to wait for garbage collection to run.</p>

<p>Structs are also good at a number of things, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Data Encapsulation</li>
<li>Polymorphism</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sowhichshouldyouuse">So which should you use?</h3>

<p>The answer, as always, is that it depends. Take a look at the lists above. Are you trying to hide implementation details? Use a Class. Are you taking advantage of abstraction, composition, or inheritance? Use a Class. Otherwise, you could use a Struct. I would even argue when you're using abstraction, if you're not inverting control, do you really need the abstract? True, you should strive to eliminate duplicate code, but sometimes it's worth a little exploration to see if one performs better than the other. Remember, it's a fine balancing act between a writing clean code and writing software that users <strong><em>want</em></strong> to use. If you're going to go against the grain though, make sure you comment as to <em>why</em> you are doing so.</p>

<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

<p>Let's say that you need to handle some events that look like this.</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClassCreatedEvent
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public DateTime Stamp { get; set; }

    public MyClassCreatedEvent(int id, DateTime stamp)
    {
        Id = id;
        Stamp = stamp;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>There's nothing wrong with this, but couldn't it be as simple as:</p>

<pre><code>public struct MyClassCreatedEvent
{
    public int Id;
    public DateTime Stamp;

    public MyClassCreatedEvent(int id, DateTime stamp)
    {
        Id = id;
        Stamp = stamp;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>There really isn't much difference between the two, but there's no reason at this point to make it a Class. I say 'at this point' because you may need to change it down the road. <strong>That's okay.</strong> Software changes, it's inevitable. This is where YAGNI comes into play. If you don't need it <em>right now</em>, then don't waste effort on building it right now. This again is a balancing act, but the point is to not do more than you need to, because what you think you need may change tomorrow.</p>]]></description><link>http://leftofnull.com/2014/03/19/constant-vigilance-classes-or-structs-in-c/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">25b83864-0ce7-4b37-bd09-f83f62e59ed1</guid><category><![CDATA[C#]]></category><category><![CDATA[YAGNI]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alexander Kahoun]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2014 02:52:46 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Using GitHub Pages with Ghost and Buster on Windows (part 2)]]></title><description><![CDATA[<h1 id="hackingbusteranddeploying">Hacking Buster and Deploying  </h1>

<a href='http://leftofnull.com/2014/02/07/using-github-pages-with-ghost-and-buster-on-windows-part-1' >Part 1: Taking Inventory and Setting Up</a><br/>
Part 2: Hacking Buster and Deploying</p>

<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>

<p>In the first part of the series we talked about setting up your Windows machine with Node.js, Python, MinGW, Git Bash, and Pip. If you haven't done so already, please use the link to part one above.</p>

<h2 id="gettingghost">Getting Ghost</h2>

<p>Let's get start on getting you set up with the Ghost blogging engine. You should start by heading over to the <a href='https://github.com/tryghost/Ghost' >Ghost GitHub Repository</a>. The README has a lot of great info in it and goes over various ways to install. We'll cover cloning the repo so you can run it locally. Let's start by firing up your Git Bash and entering the following:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd ~
</code></pre>

<p>This assumes that you want to run everything in your users directory, if not change to a path where you want to install ghost. Now we'll clone ghost.</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost.git
$ cd ghost
$ npm install --production
$ npm start
</code></pre>

<p>You should have Ghost running on the default url <code></code>. You can start to create an admin profile and access the admin settings any time at <code>/ghost</code>. Now if you want to set a specific URL for your GitHub Page let's set that repo up on GitHub first. Go ahead and hit <code>Ctrl+C</code> in your Git Bash.</p>

<h2 id="settingupyourgithubrepoforgithubpages">Setting up your GitHub repo for GitHub pages</h2>

<p>The best info, as always, can be found from GitHub themselves at <a href='http://pages.github.com/' >GitHub Pages</a>. As a quick abbreviated version, we'll set up a new repo for this exercise. Go to your GitHub account and create a new repo.  </p>

<iframe src='https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=B1874DF728CD0FC6&resid=B1874DF728CD0FC6%219654&authkey=ACZ-3NSLodjpZhM'  width="240" height="153" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>  

<p>Name the new repo whatever makes sense to you. Make sure to select Initialize with README. It's not necessary but it makes the next step that much quicker. Now in your new repo, create a new branch called <code>gh-pages</code>. It's very important that it be exact, this is what GitHub Pages works on.  </p>

<iframe src='https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=B1874DF728CD0FC6&resid=B1874DF728CD0FC6%219656&authkey=AFH88ehOx1cmsxo'  width="247" height="190" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>  

<p>When you're finished it should look like this:  </p>

<iframe src='https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=B1874DF728CD0FC6&resid=B1874DF728CD0FC6%219657&authkey=ADo432-85ddiU7M'  width="189" height="204" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>  

<h3 id="settingupyournewsiteingitlocally">Setting up your new site in git locally</h3>

<p>Now that you have the repo set up, let's pull it down. There should be a link in the bottom right of your repo page on GitHub that looks like this:  </p>

<iframe src='https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=B1874DF728CD0FC6&resid=B1874DF728CD0FC6%219658&authkey=AKFukIEDiA2OKe4'  width="191" height="94" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>  

<p>Click the "copy to clipboard button to grab the clone url" <br />
Fire up your Git Bash again and use the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/leftofnull/mywebsite.git &lt;this will be the url you copied, not this exact one&gt;
$ git checkout -b gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>You should now have your repo set up!</p>

<h2 id="modifyingthedefaulturlinghost">Modifying the default URL in Ghost</h2>

<p>Make sure Ghost is not running. Navigate in the file explorer to where you cloned Ghost and look for <code>config.js</code>. Open it any any text editor and find the <code>url:</code> property and change it to http://<em>username</em>.github.io/<em>repository</em>.</p>

<h2 id="hackingbuster">Hacking Buster</h2>

<p>Unfortunately for Windows users Buster was not designed with Windows in mind. So we'll have to do a little hacking. I have a forked version of the Buster repo that can be cloned here:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/leftofnull/buster.git
$ cd buster
</code></pre>

<p>The original repo can be found at <a href='https://github.com/axitkhurana/buster' >https://github.com/axitkhurana/buster</a>. The main differences are in the <code>buster/buster.py</code> file.</p>

<p>Starting at line 39, original:</p>

<pre><code>if arguments['generate']:
    command = ("wget \\"
               "--recursive \\"
               "--convert-links \\"
               "--page-requisites \\"
               "--no-parent \\"
               "--directory-prefix {1} \\"
               "--no-host-directories \\"
               "{0}").format(arguments['--domain'], static_path)
</code></pre>

<p>And the modified version: </p>

<pre><code>if arguments['generate']:
    command = ("wget "
               "--recursive "
               "--convert-links "
               "--page-requisites "
               "--no-parent "
               "--directory-prefix {1} "
               "--no-host-directories "
               "--restrict-file-names=unix "
               "{0}").format(arguments['--domain'], static_path)
</code></pre>

<p>We've removed the <code>\\</code> characters as they cause Windows to escape the string, in *nix based systems it allows you to use a carriage return and keep typing the same command. We've also added the <code>--restrict-file-names=unix</code> flag which will prevent some of the default escaping in html files that Windows performs with <code>wget</code>. This also negates the <code>--convert-links</code> flag unfortunately, we'll fix that in a minute.</p>

<p>Next on line 50, original:</p>

<pre><code>file_regex = re.compile(r'.*?(\?.*)')
</code></pre>

<p>We'll need to modify and add another regex:</p>

<pre><code>file_regex = re.compile(r".*?(@.*)")
html_regex = re.compile(r".*?(\.html)")
</code></pre>

<p>We have to modify the file_regex for Windows and we're going to create another to identify html files.</p>

<p>At line 52 in the original:</p>

<pre><code>for filename in filenames:
    if file_regex.match(filename):
        newname = re.sub(r'\?.*', '', filename)
        print "Rename", filename, "=&gt;", newname
        os.rename(os.path.join(root, filename), os.path.join(root, newname))
</code></pre>

<p>We'll tweak to: </p>

<pre><code>for filename in filenames:
    if html_regex.match(filename):
        path = ("{0}").format(os.path.join(root, filename).replace("\\", "/"))
        with open(path, "r+") as f:
            file_contents = f.read()
            file_contents = file_contents.replace(arguments['--domain'], "")
            f.seek(0)
            f.write(file_contents)
            f.close()
    if file_regex.match(filename):
        newname = re.sub(r'@.*', '', filename)
        print "Rename", filename, "=&gt;", newname
        os.rename(os.path.join(root, filename), os.path.join(root, newname))
</code></pre>

<p>Here's our big cheat. We're going through all html files and swapping out any instances of the root url, in this case <a href='/' ></a> or where ever you're running it locally and replacing it with a relative url path. <strong>Hacking Complete!</strong> As you can imagine, this has some built in performance degradation, but it works!</p>

<h2 id="installingyourmodifiedbuster">Installing your modified Buster</h2>

<p>Open your Git Bash, if you haven't already, and use the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd ~
$ cd buster
$ python setup.py install
$ buster --version
0.1.2
</code></pre>

<p>That's it!</p>

<h2 id="settingupbuster">Setting up Buster</h2>

<p>Run the setup and when it asks for your GitHub url, use the one you will be using for your gh-pages that you set up earlier. If you need to, grab the clone url again before you start.</p>

<pre><code>$ buster setup
</code></pre>

<p>And follow the prompts.</p>

<p>Now you'll need to open another instance of Git Bash and run:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd ~
$ cd ghost
$ npm start
</code></pre>

<p>If you didn't finish setting up the admin stuff before, you'll need to set it up now. You should have the welcome post by default, we'll leave that for now so we can test it out. Once that's finished, leave Ghost running and switch back to the Git Bash where you ran the setup for Buster from. </p>

<pre><code>$ buster generate --domain= --dir=/c/users/username/mywebsite
$ buster deploy --dir=/c/users/username/mywebsite
</code></pre>

<p>This will generate the static content and deploy your site to the gh-pages branch in GitHub. You can try navigating there by putting the http://<em>username</em>.github.io/<em>repository</em> in the location bar of any browser window.</p>

<p>That's it! You now have a blog on GitHub Pages with Ghost and Buster. Any time you want to add new blogs or modify it, just run ghost locally, make the changes, and run the buster generate and deploy commands. Let me know in the comments if you run into any issues. Happy Coding!</p>]]></description><link>http://leftofnull.com/2014/02/24/using-github-pages-with-ghost-and-buster-on-windows-part-2/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">e9921512-c54e-4bc6-9752-90addf06fdef</guid><category><![CDATA[node.js]]></category><category><![CDATA[blog]]></category><category><![CDATA[gh-pages]]></category><category><![CDATA[github pages]]></category><category><![CDATA[ghost]]></category><category><![CDATA[buster]]></category><category><![CDATA[windows]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alexander Kahoun]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2014 04:57:14 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Using GitHub Pages with Ghost and Buster on Windows (part 1)]]></title><description><![CDATA[<h1 id="takinginventoryandsettingup">Taking Inventory and Setting Up  </h1>

<h2 id="listofsoftware">List of software</h2>

<p>I'm assuming you have a GitHub account already, if not go <a href='http://github.com/' >create one</a> now. I'll wait.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href='http://nodejs.org/download/' >node.js windows installer</a></li>
<li><a href='http://msysgit.github.io/' >Git Bash windows installer</a></li>
<li><a href='http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/latest/download?source=files' >MinGW</a> (or Cygwin, I use MinGW for this post)</li>

<li><a href='https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py' >PIP for Python</a> (right click and file>save as "get-pip.py")</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="installingnodejs">Installing node.js</h2>

<p><a href='http://nodejs.org/download/' >node.js download</a></p>

<p>Installing node.js on Windows is really straight forward and very easy thanks to Joyent's installer.  It truly is just a next, next, finish install. The one thing to watch out for is to make sure that you can access node and npm after the install. You may have to reboot for it to take full effect.</p>

<p>Let's make sure node is installed properly. Open a console and type in:</p>

<pre><code>node --version
</code></pre>

<p>If it's installed properly, you should get a response like this: <br />
<code>v0.10.25</code> keep in mind your version may be different from when this article was written.</p>

<p>Now let's make sure NPM is installed correctly:</p>

<pre><code>npm --version
</code></pre>

<p>Expect similar output as the first statement, but the versions won't match and they aren't meant to either. If you're having any trouble, try rebooting and repeating these steps first.</p>

<h2 id="installinggitbash">Installing Git Bash</h2>

<p><a href='http://msysgit.github.io/' >Git Bash download</a></p>

<p>The installation of the Git Bash in Windows is done equally as well. It's another next, next, finish. There are some extra options that display during the install, but as long as you stick with all the defaults, i.e. don't change anything, you'll be fine.</p>

<h2 id="installingmingw">Installing MinGW</h2>

<p><a href='http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/latest/download?source=files' >MinGW download</a></p>

<p>Here's where we start to get a little more difficult. Follow the prompts and leave the default settings. Feel free to change the install directory, in fact it's very important that you keep track of it. For this reason, I installed it to <code>C:\dev\MinGW</code>. This will come into play as we install Python and when we modify our <code>PATH</code>. Once you have it installed, you'll want to set up the packages that we'll be using. Let's launch the MinGW Installation Manager.</p>

<p>Select the <strong>Basic Setup</strong> from the menu on the left. We just need to make sure we have two packages here, <code>mingw32-base</code> and <code>msys-base</code>. It should look like this.  </p>

<iframe src='https://skydrive.live.com/embed?cid=B1874DF728CD0FC6&resid=B1874DF728CD0FC6%219530&authkey=ADt-z29oEMAMSwA'  width="319" height="139" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

<p>Now let's get one other package we'll need. Click on the <strong>All Packages</strong> and scroll down to find msys-wget and set that package to install. Lastly click the <em>Installation</em> menu at the top and then <em>Apply Changes</em>. When you're done it should look like this.  </p>

<iframe src='https://skydrive.live.com/embed?cid=B1874DF728CD0FC6&resid=B1874DF728CD0FC6%219531&authkey=AC0bSwJ-I44iuX8'  width="319" height="139" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

<p>As a final touch we're going to have to modify our <code>PATH</code> environment variable.</p>

<h2 id="modifyingyourpath">Modifying your <code>PATH</code>  </h2>

<p>Use the <code>[Windows Key] + [Pause/Break Key]</code> to launch your System Properties dialog. From here you'll want to click on the <em>Advanced System settings</em>. As soon as that dialog launches, click on the <em>Environment Variables...</em> button at the bottom.</p>

<iframe src='https://skydrive.live.com/embed?cid=B1874DF728CD0FC6&resid=B1874DF728CD0FC6%219532&authkey=ANjXy0aH7FysxVQ'  width="288" height="319" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>  

<p>Select the <code>PATH</code> variable and click <em>Edit</em>. All the values are semi-colon delimited. We'll need to add two new ones. Move to the end of the line of values and now make sure you add to following so the end looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>;C:\dev\MINGW\msys\1.0\Bin;C:\dev\MINGW\Bin;
</code></pre>

<p>This will add all the msys tools and the mingw tools to your path so you can access them from any command prompt in Windows.</p>

<h2 id="installingpython">Installing Python</h2>

<p><a href='http://www.python.org/download/' >Python 2.7 download</a></p>

<p>Make sure you grab the 2.7.6 version or earlier. 3.0 or higher will not work right now. The author of buster is using the <code>print</code> statement throughout the package and in version 3 they changed it to a method call <code>print()</code>.</p>

<p>Here I changed the installation directory to <code>C:\dev\Python27</code> to keep all the libraries in the same root folder.</p>

<p>Once complete we'll need to modify the <code>PATH</code> again. Make sure you add the following to the end of the <code>PATH</code> values:</p>

<pre><code>;C:\dev\Python27;C:\dev\Python27\scripts;
</code></pre>

<p>This will add Python and any scripts you install to the <code>PATH</code> so they can be called from any command prompt in Windows.</p>

<p><strong>Let's test it!</strong></p>

<p>Launch your Git Bash, or preferred command prompt. Type in the following command and if you get a version number back, you're good!</p>

<pre><code>python --version
</code></pre>

<h2 id="installingpip">Installing PIP</h2>

<p><a href='https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py' >PIP download</a></p>

<p>Don't get scared when you click on that link, it's supposed to look like that. Just right click anywhere on that page and select <em>Save As...</em>. Make sure to name the file <code>get-pip.py</code>. I would suggest saving it to the <code>C:\dev</code> folder to make it easy.</p>

<p>Once that's done, let's launch Git Bash and type in the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd /c/dev

<p>Let's face it programming a computer is a little more involved than programming a VCR (if you're old enough to remember those, <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vcr' >Wikipedia</a> for those that don't). Those of us that have been doing it for a while can make it look easy but part of that starts with our tools. Let's look at the developers second most critical tool. An <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment' >IDE</a>.</p>

<p>This topic came up where I currently work, <a href='http://www.neudesic.com/Pages/default.aspx' >Neudesic</a>, with some other developers. They were soliciting advice on what IDEs we preferred for what languages. Understandably there was a lot of feedback and a lot of discussion on what was best. I'm only going to cover some for .NET and JavaScript because this post would never end if I didn't cut it off somewhere.</p>

<h3 id="whatisanide">What is an IDE</h3>

<p>IDE stands for integrated development environment. It's a software tool that helps you write code. Some key features in this regard are intelligent code completion, build engines, source control integration, debuggers, and project file management. Some IDEs have all of these features, while others have a mixture of them. Like I said , they are tools that help you write code. If your IDE isn't helping you write code, you've chosen the wrong one.</p>

<h3 id="oneidetorulethemall">One IDE to rule them all</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>What's the best IDE? There isn't one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You may have to switch IDEs based on what language you are currently writing in. You may find that you don't <em>have to</em> but you may want to due to languages. Some IDEs are better or have more features for certain languages. Take, for instance, Visual Studio. There are extensions galore for web development that really make JavaScript a first-class citizen, yet when I developed in <a href='http://coffeescript.org/' >CoffeeScript</a> I preferred Sublime Text. One thing to keep in mind when reading on is that I will focus more on the ones I've used most. Another thing to keep in mind is that an IDE is a matter of preference.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The key here is that you want to choose the IDE that suits <strong><em>you</em></strong>. Your collegues may have different preferences and may espout their chosen IDEs features, but if it doesn't work for you then you may as well get a pipe and smack you keyboard and call it coding.</p>

<h2 id="netides">.NET IDEs</h2>

<h3 id="visualstudio">Visual Studio</h3>

<p>How can we not start here. It's the main-stay of .NET IDEs and it's what I use on a daily basis. Visual Studio comes in a variety of flavors, Express (free), Professional, Premium, and Ultimate. </p>

<p>The main drawback of Express is that there isn't just <em>one</em> version. There are several that all depend on what you want to do. There's one specifically for <a href='http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs' #d-express-web">web</a>, one for <a href='http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs' #d-express-windows-desktop">desktop</a>, one for <a href='http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs' #d-express-windows-8">RT</a> (interface formerly known as metro), one for <a href='http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs' #d-express-windows-phone">Phone</a>, etc. They all have MSTest built in too so you can create unit tests. To be honest, for open source projects or single dev shops, you don't really need much more. One <strong>major</strong> drawback is that you can't install extensions like you can for the Pro and higher versions, which means no ReSharper.</p>

<p><a href='http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs' #d-professional">Professional</a> is identical to the Express editions with the addition of extensions (yay <a href='http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/' >ReSharper</a> support), and it's <em>one</em> version. Over the years the Professional version has become really watered down and, in my opinion, doesn't cut the mustard for large projects anymore.</p>

<p>Which brings us to <a href='http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs' #d-premium">Premium</a>. All of the versions are buy-ups so to speak, so you get all the goodies of the lower-priced versions but with added features. The biggest thing that Premium gets you is the Team tools. From here you can solicit code reviews, view your tasks for the project/sprint, perform code reviews for others, etc. When I say solicit code reviews, I don't just mean create a task, I mean full-featured reviews. You can create a task for someone and they can open that task and see all of the files you changed and do a side-by-side comparison of the changes. You even get to highlight and comment the changed code and send those comments back. When you get the comments you can click on them and it will jump you right to the line under discussion. Really cool feature and essential for larger teams.</p>

<p>Last is <a href='http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs' #d-ultimate">Ultimate</a>. Which has all of the features. The two big draws here are the Architecture tools and the Load and Performance test tools. In earlier versions of VS you could perform Load and Performance tests at the Premium SKU, but as of 2012 that has changed. If you're on a larger team/project, I recommend that at least one person have one of these licenses.</p>

<h3 id="alternativenetides">Alternative .NET IDEs</h3>

<p>Alternatives are <a href='http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/' >SharpDevelop</a>, which I haven't used but I hear is a very nice alternative to VS. Another one is <a href='http://monodevelop.com/' >MonoDevelop</a>, which if you're doing development in Mono instead of C#, you have a choice of VS or MD, but MD is really nice at it. If JetBrains were to create an IDE for .NET and package ReSharper into it, I have a feeling that would become dominant (<em>hint hint JetBrains :-)</em>).</p>

<h2 id="javascriptides">JavaScript IDEs  </h2>

<h3 id="webmatrixhttpwwwmicrosoftcomwebwebmatrix"><a href='http://www.microsoft.com/web/webmatrix/' >WebMatrix</a></h3>

<p>This is a really nice free offering from Microsoft. If you're a .NET developer making a transition to Node.js or just don't want to load Visual Studio, this is a really great stepping stone. It has default templates for .NET Web Projects and Node.js projects among many others. It will also automatically configure your IISExpress to run Node.js websites. You can even install a NPM extension that lets you grab packages right from the IDE.</p>

<h3 id="webstormhttpwwwjetbrainscomwebstorm"><a href='http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/' >WebStorm</a></h3>

<p>This one is by JetBrains and is a world class web IDE. It's biggest draws are going to be the intellisense (code completion) and refactoring tools. It's a really nice IDE and feels very comfortable to work in. You can <strong>try before you buy</strong> and can pick up a personal license for $49 (USD).</p>

<h3 id="sublimetexthttpwwwsublimetextcom"><a href='http://www.sublimetext.com/' >Sublime Text</a></h3>

<p>This one is my personal favorite. It's comparable to TextMate if you're familiar with it. It can even use TextMate packages. It has word completion instead of code completion out of the box so you'll have to be aware of that going in. You can enable <a href='http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/vintage.html' >VIM-mode</a> out of the box too (this may not be for everyone, but my beard demands it). The thing that really sells Sublime Text for me is the packages and a package called <a href='https://sublime.wbond.net/installation' >Package Control</a>. It makes installing packages a few keystrokes away. There is a rich community developing packages for Sublime Text and you could even create your own. Want JavaScript Snippets? It's there. What Express.js Snippets? They're there too. How about jsLint or jsHint? Yup. You can make it be as robust as all the other IDEs or as simple as notepad. It's completely up to you. After using it for CoffeeScript, JavaScript, and as my primary Node.js IDE it makes Visual Studio feel like an 80-tool swiss army knife (nice, but unweildy). You can <strong>try before you buy</strong> and can pick up a personal license for $70 (USD).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No matter what IDE you choose, make sure you learn the ins and outs of it. There are things that an IDE can do to make your life so much easier when coding. Don't ignore those things and make sure you fully explore. Happy Coding!</p>
